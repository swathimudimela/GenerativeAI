Makemore , makes more of things that you give it. Example if it is given say 30k names, it will try to make more things that sound more like unique names.
Make more is a character level language model. Treats every single line as an example and each character in it a squence. It takes sequence of characters and tries to predict the next character.

We try to implement a Bigram where a character will try to predict the next character with a lookup table
